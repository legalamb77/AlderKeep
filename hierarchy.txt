Make a small text game with a battle scene at the end, basic rpg stuff.

-You are a Brave Knight entering Alder Keep, and you seek to rid the land of the evil lich king.
-Opening scene starts with a text prompt which allows you to choose a best and worst stat.
-Rooms have small zork-style text adventure stuff.
-Final room has a boss battle where optional items can be used to win.
